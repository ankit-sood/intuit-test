Here’s a template you can use to present your solution for the craft assignment. The structure is designed to clearly communicate your approach, technical details, and results:

Craft Assignment Presentation Template

1. Introduction
	•	Objective: Clearly state the problem or assignment goal.
	•	Example: “The objective is to build a feature that enables users to set up budgets tied to specific financial goals, similar to functionality in QuickBooks.”
	•	Overview: Briefly outline your approach to solving the problem.

2. Solution Overview
	•	Architecture Diagram: Include a diagram to show the high-level design of your solution (e.g., microservices, APIs, databases, etc.).
	•	Technologies Used: List the tools, frameworks, and programming languages.
	•	Example: “Python for backend development, Flask for APIs, PostgreSQL for database, and Docker for containerization.”

3. Implementation Details
	•	Backend:
	•	Explanation of APIs or core business logic.
	•	Include code snippets for critical parts.
	•	Database Design:
	•	Schema diagram or description of key tables.
	•	Justify your design choices (e.g., normalization, indexing).
	•	Integration and Workflow:
	•	How the components interact (request-response cycle, third-party integrations, etc.).
	•	Highlight any asynchronous workflows or batch processing.

4. Challenges and Solutions
	•	Discuss challenges you faced during implementation and how you resolved them.
	•	Example: “Handling edge cases for overlapping budget periods required introducing a validation layer in the API.”

5. Performance Considerations
	•	Discuss any optimizations or scalability considerations you implemented.
	•	Example: “Implemented caching using Redis to reduce database query load.”

6. Testing Strategy
	•	Unit Tests: Coverage of key functionalities.
	•	Integration Tests: Ensuring all components work together seamlessly.
	•	Manual Testing: Mention any user flows you tested manually.

7. Trade-offs and Alternatives
	•	Acknowledge any trade-offs in your solution and why you chose one approach over another.
	•	Example: “I chose a document-based database like MongoDB for its flexibility in handling unstructured budget data, but acknowledged the lack of strict relational constraints compared to PostgreSQL.”

8. Security Measures
	•	Highlight how you ensured data security (e.g., encryption, validation).
	•	Example: “Implemented input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and ensured sensitive data like user goals are encrypted at rest.”

9. Monitoring and Maintenance
	•	Discuss how you would handle logging, monitoring, and error tracking.
	•	Example: “Integrated structured logging and set up alerts using tools like ELK Stack to monitor API performance and errors.”

10. API Documentation or UX Mockups
	•	Include a sample API documentation snippet (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI format) or front-end mockups to demonstrate how developers/users would interact with your system.

11. Scalability and Future Growth
	•	Address how your solution can scale or be extended in the future.
	•	Example: “The system is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to add support for multiple currencies or regional tax regulations.”

12. Demo (Optional)
	•	Prepare a short live demo or a recorded walkthrough showcasing your solution.
	•	Highlight key features and user workflows.

13. Conclusion
	•	Recap your solution.
	•	Highlight its strengths (e.g., scalability, extensibility).
	•	Mention potential future improvements or extensions.

14. Q&A Preparation
	•	Anticipate questions the interviewers might ask (e.g., trade-offs, alternative approaches).
	•	Be ready to justify your design decisions and discuss edge cases.
